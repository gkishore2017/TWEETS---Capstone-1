🏗️ Project Overview
The project focuses on analyzing cement manufacturing data to understand the relationships between various components and the compressive strength of cement.
The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the strength of cement based on its constituent materials.

🔍 Key Objectives
Explore the dataset to identify patterns and correlations between different cement components.
Develop regression models to predict the compressive strength of cement.
Evaluate the performance of different models to determine the most accurate predictor.

🧪 Methodology
Data Exploration & Visualization:
Utilized libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Visualized relationships between variables using scatter plots and correlation matrices.

Data Preprocessing:
Checked for missing values and ensured data cleanliness.
Standardized features to ensure uniformity across variables.

Model Development:
Implemented multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

Model Evaluation:
Assessed models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) score.
Compared the performance of different models to select the best predictor.

📊 Key Findings
Certain components, such as cement and water content, showed strong correlations with compressive strength.
The Random Forest Regressor outperformed other models, achieving the highest R² score, indicating better predictive accuracy.
Feature importance analysis revealed that cement content was the most significant predictor of strength.
